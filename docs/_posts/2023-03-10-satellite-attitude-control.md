### Fall 2020 Term Project - MSE in Energy Systems Engineering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a group project, completed with two other team members - Chase Richard and Mohammad Fahs. In this project, our goal was to model and analyze a stat-space representation of an attitude control system. Additionally, we explored the sensitivity of the system response due to sampling frequency and the tuning of the PID parameters.
