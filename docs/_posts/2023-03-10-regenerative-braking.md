### Fall 2021 Term Project - MSE in Energy Systems Engineering
This project was completed individually, based on a topic that I selected within the bounds of the ECE517 class learnings but also something that I personally found interesting. It involved development of a MATLAB Simulink model to approximate some of the dynamics around a single brushless DC motor in an automotive application. The focus of the project was on the development of a six-switch inverter control strategy that would allow for regenerative braking, charging the battery that was also used to drive the motor. Additionally, the supporting electrical hardware needed is detailed and modeled.

#### Abstract
Brushless DC motors are commonly found in automotive applications. These motors require a controlled three-phase current to operate under standard conditions. This control is commonly implemented by use of a six-switch inverter. It is also desirable to include regenerative braking as a feature for battery and hybrid electric vehicles, requiring additional controls and hardware for implementation. This project introduces a modified six-switch inverter strategy for providing
brake torque and regenerative capability. It also details the supporting hardware and controls necessary to implement the modified six-switch inverter strategy into a battery electric vehicle architecture.
