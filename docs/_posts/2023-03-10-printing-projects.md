### 3D Printing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you can find a few snapshots of 3D printing projects that I've completed. All of these have been modeled by myself using Autodesk Fusion 360. My current print setup includes a Creality CR6SE that has been modified (dual-gear extruder, community firmware).

#### Silica Container

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was out of necessity. I was having issues printing with PLA filament that had collected moisture during humid months of the year. To counter this, I purchased a large container of silica gel pellets and an air-tight container. All of my filament resides in the air-tight container, and I added a few of these Silica Containers printed and filled with the silica gel pellets. With a temperature/humidity sensor, the system is able to keep my filament ~10% lower humidity than the environment.

#### Bottle Cage

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classic update to my bike. Instead of looking for a simple and inexpensive bottle cage, I challenged myself to design and print my own. The design is bespoke for my waterbottle, but should fit any 750ml Camelbak bottle. It's worked for some light gravel-based biking, but I wouldn't take it off a jump.

#### Dice Tower

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining two of my hobbies (D&D and 3D Printing) seemed like a natural fit. The goal for this project was to remain functional while looking like an actual brick tower. The texturing on the tower itself was created using a rotational pattern, offsetting the initial feature by a small amount for each new row. The center includes a spiral slide that prints without supports, turning twice before depositing any dropped dice into the landing area. Overall, the design works well and looks clean too.

#### Very Large D20

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again on the theme of D&D, I built a very large D20 as a gift for several of my friends. The model itself was created using the geometric principals of an icosahedron. Each face of the D20 was modeled as a surface and stitched to existing faces, oriented at 138.19Â° from one another (interior angle). After all of the 20 pieces were connected, it was converted to a solid object. Numbers were embossed on each surface. A downsized version is also provided for those not willing to undertake the significant print time of the very large D20.
