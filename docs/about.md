# I'm Greg.

_Engineer by trade_ <br>
_3D printing enthusiast_ <br>
_Board game developer and enjoyer_ <br>

In 2015, I graduated from Colorado State University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. By my senior year, I had a focus in controls development; specifically supporting the EcoCAR3 competition as part of the first year software & controls team. With this background in automotive and controls development I moved to Michigan and started working on electrification projects with General Motors. 

From 2015 to 2021, I supported exciting new programs and helped to build electric vehicles with robust software and controls. From 2021 to now, I have still been focused on electrification but working with projects under GM Defense.

My desire to grow in engineering had me pursue a masters program at the University of Dearborn. In December of 2021, I graduated with an MSE in Energy Systems Engineering. The knowledge learned through that program has boosted my capabilities at GM, while simultaneously allowing me to explore different applications for software and controls.

I am always looking for the next step. My personal ambition is to use my talents for math, physics, and passion for science to create new and exciting tools to help build a better world.
