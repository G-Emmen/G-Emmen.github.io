### Hello. My name is Greg.

<img style="float:left; margin:1.5em;" src="/assets/img/ProfilePic.jpg"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my personal website. I am a software and controls engineer working in the automotive & defense industries. My talents are in rapid prototyping, adaptable programming skills, and creative problem solving. I have a passion for creating new and useful technology to build a better world. If you would like to get in touch, the best method is by email at <greg.emmen@gmail.com>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my undergraduate degree, I pursued a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Colorado State University. My senior design project was to support the CSU EcoCAR3 team in year-one of competition as a part of the controls team. Our goal was to build an initial system architecture to support supervisory control algorithms that would facilitate the build of a hybrid-electric Chevrolet Camaro. Working on the EcoCAR3 project led to exposure with industry technology and sponsor companies, ultimately connecting myself with General Motors for the start of my career.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At GM I have always been focused on supporting electrification programs. Initially I supported Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing environments to support software testing and control validation. I then moved to support software & controls integration directly, developing logic and code to support propulsion enablement across various controllers in our electric vehicles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working at GM I completed a graduate degree program at the University of Michigan - Dearborn, earning an MSE in Energy Systems Engineering. This program expanded my knowledge of controls engineering as well as general concepts in large and small scale energy systems. The ability to work on unique projects within and outside of my personal focus area has been invaluable. The learnings from this program have expanded my capabilities as an engineer, and I have been able to apply those talents towards my career making transitions to unique project areas within GM.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two years I have been supporting programs under GM Defense. This has included working in a fast-pace startup style environment looking to deliver prototype vehicles for clients and customers outside of the typical automotive world. The new challenges that come with this environment have been exciting to overcome.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to the future, I am interested in opportunities to grow my talents and capabilities in ways that will benefit the good of all people. While my career continues to grow I hope to support my hobbies such as 3D printing and board game development - improving my skills in areas that aren't directly involved in software & controls engineering.
